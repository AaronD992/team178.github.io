## *FIRST*

*FIRST*, or For Inspiration & Recognition of Science & Technology, is an organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen in 1989 in order to develop ways to inspire students in engineering and technology fields. The organization is the foundation for the *FIRST* Robotics Competition, *FIRST* Lego League, *FIRST* Lego League Junior, and *FIRST* Tech Challenge competitions.

*FIRST* seeks to promote a philosophy of teamwork and collaboration among engineers and encourages competing teams to remain friendly, helping each other out when necessary. The term frequently applied to this ethos is "gracious professionalism," a term coined by Woodie Flowers which supports respect towards one's competitors and integrity in one's actions. As Dean Kamen is so fond of saying, *FIRST* is not about building robots. At every level of competition *FIRST* is about getting people involved in Engineering in a fun and interesting way.
