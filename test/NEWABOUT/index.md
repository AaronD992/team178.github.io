The 2nd Law Enforcers have been an active participant in *FIRST* (For Inspiration & Recognition of Science & Technology) since our rookie year in 1997. Our team has been encouraging Farmington High School students to engage in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math) throughout this time. And with that, we have been able to create many relationships with sponsors, mentors, and our entire community. From engaging with younger FLL (*FIRST* Lego League) Jr. teams to hosting large events with many levels of *FIRST*, we are very proud of our community presence. With that though, we also emphasize teaching and learning within our team so all members have the skills necessary of pursuing STEAM in their future. This relationship between community presence and active learning within the team is something we stress as being Enforcers.

Our team is structured into two different groups, the engineering committee of representatives (eCOR) and the outreach committee of representatives (cCOR). eCOR is responsible for the design, building and maintenance of the robot and playing field while oCOR is responsible for non-engineering related aspects of the team, such as community outreach, fundraising, and much more. However, this does not mean that the students are locked into one single group. We encourage everyone to be a part of both so they learn about both important characteristics of our team. Here's some information about each.

oCOR's main focus is both reaching out and giving back to our community. When reaching out to the community (like we are doing right now!), we want to show the community what our team is all about. This could be through fundraising like with our annual raffle or Business Blitz where we reach out to the many local businesses. Through these types of interactions, we get a better connection with the local community around us and show our active presence and importance to the community. Besides this, we also want to give back to our community. We do this through the many different outreach events we attend, run, and host. These events range from inspiring young generations in STEAM by running our own FLL Qualifier and *FIRST* Expo, to visiting elders in Middlewoods to teach them more about current technology. All of these have one thing in common: inspiring generations to appreciate the ideals of STEAM.

While oCOR is running and responsible for the outreach aspect of our team, eCOR is responsible for the engineering side which includes designing, building, and coding of the robot and test playing field. During our build season, eCOR is building, programming, CADing, and pretty much creating an entire robot from scratch in 6-7 weeks. The one goal is to prepare the robot for competition in March. In order to do this, students are also creating test field elements to imitate the playing field so that the drive team can practice driving the robot before competition. Team members are able to learn so much during this time from coaches, mentors and other members as they learn the skills required to build a robot as well as communicate and collaborate as a functioning group. This truly gives students the hands on experience of tackling a problem and working collaboratively to come up with a solution.

Our team would like to especially thank UTC Otis Elevator and ebm-papst Inc. for their generous financial support. Otis funds our robot build season and pays our competition fees each year. ebm-papst Inc. has donated several industrial class tools for our workshop. Mentors from Otis, ebm-papst Inc., Sikorsky, Parker, and Fabtron, along with parents, teachers, other adult and college mentors dedicate countless hours to the students on our team helping to make *FIRST* the best experience possible for them. In turn, our students dedicate themselves through significant community outreach as we work towards making the vision of *FIRST* a reality: “… a world where science and technology are celebrated and where young people dream of becoming science and technology heroes.” (*FIRST* Founder, Dean Kamen).
