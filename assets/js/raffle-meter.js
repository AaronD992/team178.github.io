Hi! If you're reading this then you're probably not me. That means that you also
probably don't understand how this works.I'll try and help you understand. There
are a bunch of comments scattered around that should help you along. I would
suggest that you read through this code carefully; the things that you have to
change manually should be clearly marked, However, if they aren't everything
should be explained below.
THINGS TO ENTER IN YOURSELF:
* The date and time that the raffle ends.
* The number of days after the raffle that you want the meter content to change.
* The link to the Google Sheet that the information is being stored in.
* The column that the status of the books is recorded in.
* The column that the number of tickets sold is recorded in.
* The characters that are used to symbolize each state of the tickets. (If you
change it for whatever reason, please also change the comment to match.)
*(maybe) The amount "sold" is multiplied by 5 to create the money variable. (It's
explained more at the specific place in the code.)
* The message that automatically shows up when the raffle ends. (I'm still iffy
on what I've written there.)
* The year that it currently is. (I'm sure there's a way to dynamically change
that but I don't feel like coding that right now.)

WHAT THIS CODE USED TO DO:
It pulls information from a Google Spreadsheet and counts the number of 0s, 1s,
2s, 3s, and 4s there are in a specified column. The number of 0s is counted as
the number of book that haven't been touched; the 1s count as the books that are
checked out being sold; the 2s count as the number of full books that have been
sold; the 3s mark original partial books; and the 4s only appear after 3s to
mark that row as the rest of the above partial book. These numbers are then
turned into statistics that get displayed on the website as the progress bar.
There are two different ways it gets displayed based on if large-raffle-meter is
true in the front matter of the page.

If you're *still* confused after reading all of this please contact either Tim Scalzo (timothyjscalzo@gmail.com), Kate Vasilyeva (22vasilyevaek@fpsct.org)
or Giselle Koo (gisellegk@gmail.com) for
help.

For help on the updated version, email Doorva Garg (doorvagarg01@gmail.com) :D

This code was edited for simplicity since Google Sheets can do the math for us. 
The data is imported from the first 3 cells of column B in a Google Sheet.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
