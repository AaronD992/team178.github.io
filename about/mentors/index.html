<h2>Meet our mentors and coaches!</h2>
We are very grateful to have 13 mentors, 6 of whom are alumni, as a part of our team. We love to say that our team is student-driven, mentor-nurtured. So even though our mentors are not directly be leading projects, they all are essential in giving their insight and expertise to the team. They have also been able to provide us with many resources that have been essential in the functioning of our team. Two of our mentors, Tim Barron and Lisa Nollman, have received the Woodie Flowers Finalist Award as recognition of their dedication and invaluable expertise. Without our mentors, our team would not be able to run. Thank you to all of our mentors!
