## How to Submit Photos
If you're on this page then you've probably taken some pictures of/for us and want to give them to us somehow. If you're a student who has access to the Google [Shared Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z0zvhAQZjrtwMQHFN0y0TtLGELtLts0B){:target="_blank"} you should put the pictures in the proper folder by month and event.

However, if you don't have access you should email [DigitalMedia@FarmingtonRobotics.org](mailto:digitalmedia@farmingtonrobotics.org) and ask for further instructions.
