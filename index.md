### Dream *FIRST*

>Dream *FIRST* is our main outreach program for children ages 3 to 10, developed by our team. The goal of this program is to cultivate children's interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) because we believe that by training the kids at a young age, we can spark an interest in science that lasts a lifetime.
